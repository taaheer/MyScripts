**Scene:** *At night I am trying to write my story*

**Me:** *Writing on paper* "I gotta make this story good" *After few minutes* "I hate this I couldn't think, I hate when I hate my own story" *Tearing the paper and throwing in bin* "I can't be writer, I can't even write a paragraph" *Get up go toward bed*

**Scene:** *In bedroom Laying on bed looking at celling and tearing coming out my eyes*

**Me:** *Speaking to myself* "I can't be good writer, I was stupid enough to believe that I will write good story that people will appreciate but all was a lie. A lie I told myself from start" *lay by side and closed my eyes*

**Scene:** *Start dreaming, I am in strange land. Its beautiful but also broken. I can see scattered pieces everywhere*

**Me:** "Where am I?, This place feel familiar but at the same time does not."

**Scene:** *Someone put hand on my shoulder*

**Me:** *Scream and fall and saying while eye closed* "Aah, I am sorry, I don't know how I got here, I swear I am lost, I never intended to come here"

**Passion:** "Hey chill out. Just look at me"

**Me:** *Open my eye to see him* "Who are you?" *Confused* "You look just like me"

**Passion:** "Well, that because I am YOU" *laughing*

**Me:** *More confused* "Me? but if you are me then who I am?"

**Passion:** "Well, I am all you I am just part of you"

**Me:** "Part me?" *Visibly more confused* "What you do mean? and what is this place?"

**Passion:** "Oh boy, You got lost of question in your mind, well that's good, that mean you passionate!"

**Me:** "Passionate? No I am scared, This place seem familiar but there also an uneasiness"

**Passion:** "Oh, it fear, Sorry I misunderstand because both are different, they works same, You know people either work because they passionate about it or they fear something."

**Me:** "Can you just tell me where I am and who are you that looking like me"

**Passion:** *Sigh* "Ok ok claim down I will tell you. I am passion a part of you. I am your passion, that why I look like you because I am part of you and this place is your mind, your inner world, Thats why you feel this place as familiar."

**Me:** "My mind? my inner world? So why it look beautiful but so many scattered pieces around here?"

**Passion:** *Sigh* "You don't really self aware don't you.."

**Scene:** *A strange roar is heard*

**Me:** *cover my ear with hands* "What is this noise? and why its making me sick"

**Me:** *While running* "Who are they?"

**Passion:** "Who got no time to explain and run with me"

**Scene:** *They reach at a cliff and down the cliff there is nothing but darkness*

**Me:** "Where do you think we are going" *Free my hand from his grip*

**Passion:** "Look we gotta jump man"

**Passion:** "No, I inside your mind, I know it sound stupid we need to jump"

**Me:** "Stupid? no you are mad thinking that I will jump into this darkness void or whatever this is"

**Passion:** "If you stay here, they will get you and god know what will they do to you, they are very dangerous and if you want to live not just survive then jump with me"
