## E02 · Self-Sabotage

**Scene:** *They fall into the darkness and cliff started to disappear minute by minute until they could not see anything and then they fall into water.*

**Me:** *When I was falling, I started to hollow and empty inside. It was so cold that I started feel not to do anything, I didn't even try to swim up and let myself drown, Until someone grab my hand and pull me out.*

**Passion:** *He was drowning so I went to save him. I grabbed his hand and take him out. he wasn't doing anything, not even trying to save himself from drowning like he just got frozen.*

**Scene:** *Passion took him out and place near the land. [me] was not moving, not even a bit.*

**Passion:** *Frighten and scared* "Hey, response please. Please wake up. Don't leave me us alone like this."

**Me:** *Cough and came back to consciousness*

**Passion:** "Thank God your alive." *Hugged* "I thought I lost you. I thought you were dead.*

**Me:** *Pushed him* "Because I am dead."

**Passion:** "I don't think so. You are responding, breathing, blinking and talking. I think that are signs of being alive."

**Me:** "Is that so?" *Frownly looking at him* "Just because I show some signs and behaviours, and said some stupid words, is that enough to say the person is alive?"

**Passion:** *Worriedly looking at him* "What do you mean?"

**Me:** *Laughing* "Isn't that funny, my own self doesn't understand me. Are you really part of me?"

**Scene:** *For moment both don't say anything to each other.*

**Passion:** "Come on, we have to move." *Extending my hand towards him*

**Me:** *Slap out his hands* "NO, I don't wanna move. You should have just let me drown there." *Pointing at the water*

**Passion:** "Why are you saying this?"

**Me:** *With angrily voice* "Don't pretend like you care about me, I know you don't. You are just being selfish, just like everyone."

**Passion:** "Even if I am being selfish, I am being for myself, and that mean you."

**Passion:** "Your territory? You don't even belong here."

**Saboteur:** *With Intimidating look* "I do belong here" *Looking at [me] with glowing eyes* "Ain't I?

**Me:** "Yes, you do belong here. Asa  matter of fact, you are the only one I can trust."

**Passion:** "You just trust him?" *Visible confused and frustrated* *You just met him, now you already trusting him, while I am trying to make you trust me but keep failing."
