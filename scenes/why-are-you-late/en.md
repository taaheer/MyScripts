# Why are you late? (English)

**Scene:** *A man sitting in his office and his assistant open the door and say*

**Assistant:** "Sir, someone here to meet you."

**Casting director:** "Send them in." Then he thought *I didn't called anyone, who could it be*

**Scene:** *Door open and I enter the room*

**Me:** "Hi, I am [name] and I am here for audition."

**Casting director:** "Ok, but I did not called anyone for audition today."

**Me:** "Actually you did called me but 2 months ago."

**Casting director:** "What kind of transport mode you were travelling that took you 2 months to get here?" *laughing* "Anyway can you tell me how did I called you here?"

**Me:** "Yes, you messaged me through LinkedIn." *showing him the Linkedin chat*

**Casting director:** "Ahh, yes I did. Now tell me, what took you so long? why did you came after 2 months?"

**Me:** "I did came to address 2 months ago but couldn't gather enough courage and strength to step inside."

**Casting director:** "So what caused you to come here fearlessly today?."

**Me:** "When you realized that your dream will never be true if you don't act. 

When you realized that that everything you hoped for never become true.

When you realized that life will feel meaningless when you lose your dream.

That feeling, that sadness, that pressure will be enough make climb the Mount Everest if you have to."

**Casting director:** *chuckle* "So you are saying fear of losing your dream gave you enough courage and strength to come here." *pause for moment* "Thats pretty bold if ask me."

**Me:** "Not only losing my dream but my life. The thought of living the rest of my life following the same routine is horrifying to me. I rather die doing something that I loved than live my life as a zombie."

**Casting director:** "Passionate indeed. Okay we will take your audition." *calling my Assistant* "give [name] a script and take his audition."

**Scene:** *After audition I came back to his office*

**Casting director:** "Lets see how you did" *Watching audition video* "Is this your first time? It took you 4 takes to get a decent performance. *Continue to watch audition video* "look at your performance, your face not showing any emotions and you are saying your dialogue very fast, like a nursery child saying a poem, your words lack emotions."

**Me:** *Head down*

**Casting director:** "Well, I will call you if you got any role, you can go now"

**Me:** *get up and leave the office* 

**Scene:** *Teacher was waiting outside of the office and when*

**Teacher:** "Hey, how was your first audition, you nailed it?"

**Me:** *Not replying to him and eyes on the ground.*

**Teacher:** "Please say something."

**Me:** "He said..."

**Teacher:** "I am listening."

**Me:** "He said..."

**Teacher:** "I am all ear, just say it."

**Me:** "He said I am not good enough and I need to do better if wanna get cast."

**Teacher:** *Little worried* "What happened there?"

**Me:** "He said I lack emotion with my dialogue, that I was just reciting them like a child that recite a poem. and I... I took 4 takes just to get a decent audition video."

**Teacher:** *Get closer to him* "Now tell me what happened in your mind?"

**Me:** *Confused* "What do you mean?"

**Teacher:** "What you felt during audition video."

**Me:** "I.. I.. I was nervous and my emotions were frozen at that time."

**Teacher:** "Do you know why that happened? why your emotions got frozen?"

**Me:** *Silent, not replying*

**Teacher:** "Come with me"

**Me:** *I followed him and we reach to our theatre, he open the door there was the stage I used to practicing long ago*

**Teacher:** "Do you remember your first day when you came here?"

**Me:** "I do, it was my first theatre play of life after school. You needed actor for your play and you gave me a chance and started my career."

**Teacher:** "Despite being new you did well than other who also just started. Yes it took some time but you did very well."

**Me:** "I don't know, I never had acting training, Never took any actor class or workshop. All I had were books and videos."

**Teacher:** "And yet you did well."

**Me:** "I don't know, I don't feel it" *Eyes get down*

**Teacher:** *sigh* "Look, you have potential, you did better than most. Going there and facing camera itself is a win. With more guidance and practice, you will be prepared for this industry"

**Me:** "I did try my best and you said I did well."

**Teacher:** "Yes you did well, but only in theatre, Camera is very different."

**Me:** "So I am not made for on-camera acting?"

**Teacher:** "Not yet but you got the ingredients and all you need to do bake properly. You got the potential and skills, you just need to learn how to use it properly. I still remember your exceptional skill of remembering scripts quickly, which is impressive but acting is not only about memoizing lines and saying those line."

**Me:** *Nodding in agreement*

**Teacher:** "Now go to the stage and say the lines you memorized during audition."

**Me:** *Perform the monologue that I was giving at audition.*

**Teacher:** "You did great, you remembered every word correctly and performance you gave is absolute great."

**Me:** "I don't know. The casting director didn't said those things when he saw my audition video."

**Teacher:** *Hand on his shoulder* "You nailed the theatre performance but maybe you just need more practice for on-camera acting."

**Me:** "Then what is acting? if it different from theatre and on-camera."

**Teacher:** *looking at him for a while before answering* "That what you need to find out. I am just a theatre actor and director, my job is just to act and direct theatre plays. but as an actor you need to learn how to be versatile actor, you gotta learn different types of acting."

**Me:** "So when will I learn acting completely?"

**Teacher:** *Laughing* "You know, I once asked same question to my teacher as well, you know what he said?"

**Me:** "Passionate? But I didn't show any signs of me being passionate about being actor"

**Teacher:** "No you did, you just don't realize it. Anyway he said that "One can never learn acting completely. Its a continues process with no ending. You can start learning but there is no point where you can say I completely learned acting and don't need to learn more. There always be a role or character that you will fail to represent or portray, no matter how many years of experience you have or how greatest you are." His words made me realized that, I am not looking for greatest actor or experienced actor but one who can specifically portray that character the I need or writer has written. It doesn't matter how that actor look, his height, weight, color, or anything as long as it fit the character. That's why I am more toward directing than acting."

**Me:** "So what character do I fit right now?"

**Teacher:** "Right now the character you fit for is you. Your life is also a story, yes you may not be writer of your life but you have ability to influence it. You can influence writer action and decision to make your life the way you want."

**Me:** "But how, if I don't have pad and pen of my life then how will make it the way I want?"

**Teacher:** "True, you don't have pen and pad of your life but that doesn't mean you don't even has control. While you can't change your life directly but you can make choices and decisions that do affect writer's thoughts about you and change your narrative."

**Me:** "What do you mean by that? I can't understand what you saying."

**Teacher:** *sigh* "Ok then. The writer, God or whatever you call it shape your life based on your choices. here's an example, 2 months ago you had a choice, either go inside and give audition or go back home, and that time you made your choice based on fear that you were not ready and went back home. then 2 months after you got same choice, this time you made choice based on your fear, fear of losing everything and went there. same options but different choice that you made based on your feeling, perception and dream."

**Me:** "But that doesn't say that I influenced the writer's decision because I made different decision."

**Teacher:** "While it seems that you had two choices but actually not, you had more than 2 choices."

**Me:** "No, I had two choice either go inside and give audition or go back home."

**Teacher:** "Because you only thought of 2 scenarios because you thought that you had two choices only. Just think about it, you could have just come, talk to us and leave, or come and just give audition and leave, or send someone else on your behalf, might have mail or whatsapp your profile. the more you think about it, the more choices you will see, and the more outcomes there will be. I am not saying think of every scenario and become overwhelmed. My point that you have choices and each lead to different outcome, and that outcome is written by the your writer but decision that lead to that outcome if yours. if you had not come here and went home again, the outcome would be different. I hope you are understanding what I am saying."

**Me:** "Yeah, I understand now. I don't have control over other's decisions but I do have control over mine, that how I can influence other's decision. I can't change your decision over not casting me, but next time when I will give audition, with my good performance I can influence your thought over choosing me."

**Teacher:** "Exactly. Sorry that they can't cast with performance you gave on-camera, next time do come prepared. and If you give great performance next, surely you will make seat for yourself in other upcoming projects."

**Me:** "Thank you so much for your guidance. I will practice and make sure to be prepare for my next audition, whether it be here or somewhere else." *Hug teacher*

**Casting director:** *Tap on back* "Don't get too emotional because that's what you tend to do but best of luck for you practice and audition."

**Scene:** *[me] leave the theatre and waving back to teacher, he can see the burning passion and bright eyes on him and wish him best.*
