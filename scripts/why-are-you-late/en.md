# Why are you late? (English)

**Scene:** *A man sitting in his office and his assistant open the door and say*

**Assistant:** "Sir, someone here to meet you."

**Casting director:** "Send them in." Then he thought *I didn't called anyone, who it could be*

**Scene:** *Door open and I enter the room*

**Me:** "Hi, I am [name] and I am here for audition."

**Casting director:** "Ok, but I did not called anyone for audition today."

**Me:** "Actually you did called me but 2 months ago."

**Casting director:** "What kind of transport mode you were travelling that took you 2 months to get here." *laughing* "Anyway can you tell me how did I called you here?"

**Me:** "Yes, you message me through Linkedin." *showing him the Linkedin chat*

**Casting director:** "Ahh, yes I did. Now tell me, what took you so long, why you came after 2 months?"

**Me:** "I did came to address that time but couldn't gather enough courage and strength to step inside."

**Casting director:** "So what cause today that you came here fearlessly."

**Me:** "When you realized that your dream will never be true if you don't act. 

When you realized that that everything you hoped for never become true.

When you realized that life will feel meaningless when you lose your dream.

That feeling, that sadness, that pressure will be enough make climb the Mount Everest if you have to."

**Casting director:** *chuckle* "So you are saying fear of losing your dream gave you enough courage and strength to come here." *pause for moment* "Thats pretty bold if ask me."

**Me:** "Not only losing my dream but my life. The thought of me living my rest of life following same routine is horrifying to me. I rather die doing something that I loved than live my life as a zombie."

**Casting director:** "Passionate indeed. Okay we will take your audition." *calling my Assistant* "give [name] a script and take his audition."

**Scene:** *After audition I came back to his office*

**Casting director:** "Lets see how you did" *Watching audition video* "Is this your first time because it took 4 takes to get a decent looking performance. *Continue to watch audition video* "look at your performance, your face not showing any emotions and you are saying your dialogue very fast, like a nursery child saying a poem, your words lack emotions."

**Me:** *Head down*

**Casting director:** "Hey look I am not trying make you feel bad, I am saying what it is. You need to do better than that. You need to be better than this if you want to be cast."

**Me:** *Silently listening while eyes are down*

**Casting director:** *sigh* "Look you have potential, you did better than most. Coming here and facing camera itself is a win. With more guidance and practice, you will be prepared for this industry"

**Me:** "I did try my best"

**Casting director:** "Yes, but that not enough. You got the ingredients and all you need to do bake properly. You got the potential and skills, you just need to learn how to use it properly. I saw that you memorized that script in less than 5 minutes, which is impressive but acting is not only about memoizing lines and saying those line."

**Me:** "Then what is acting?"

**Casting director:** *looking at him for a while before answering* "That what you need to find out. I am just a casting director, my job is find people that suit the characters the writer has written. And its your job to show us if you really fit that character through your acting."

**Me:** "So when will I learn acting completely?"

**Casting director:** *Laughing* "You know, I once asked same thing from a passionate like you, you know what he said?"

**Me:** "Passionate? But I didn't show any signs of me being passionate about being actor"

**Casting director:** "No you did, you just don't realize it. Anyway he said that "One can never learn acting completely. Its a continues process with no ending. You can start learning but there is no point where you can say I completely learned acting and don't need to learn more. There always be a role or character that you will fail to represent or portray, no matter how many years of experience you have or how greatest you are." His words made me realized that, I am not looking for greatest actor or experienced actor but one who can specifically portray that character the director need or writer has written. It doesn't matter how that actor look, his height, weight, color, or anything as long as it fit the character."

**Me:** "So what character do I fit right now?"

**Casting director:** "Right now the character you fit for is you. Your life is also a story, yes you may not be writer of your life but you have ability to influence it. You can influence writer action and decision to make your life the way you want."

**Me:** "But how, if I don't have pad and pen of my life then how will make it the way I want?"

**Casting director:** "True, you don't have pen and pad of your life but that doesn't mean you don't even has control. While you can't change your life directly but you can make choices and decisions that do affect writer's though about you and change your narrative."

**Me:** "What do you mean by that? I can't understand what you saying."

**Casting director:** *sigh* "Ok then. The writer, God or whatever you call it shape your life based on your choices. here's an example, 2 months ago you had a choice, either go inside and give audition or go back home, and that time you made your choice based on fear that you are not ready and went back home. then 2 months after you got same choice, and this time you made choice based on your fear, fear of losing everything and came here. same options but different choice that you made based on your feeling, perception and dream."

**Me:** "But that doesn't say that I influenced the writer's decision because I made different decision."

**Casting director:** "While it seems that you had two choices but actually not, you had more than 2 choices."

**Me:** "No, I had two choice either go inside and give audition or go back home."

**Casting director:** "Because you only thought of 2 scenarios because you thought that you had two choices only. Just think about it, you could have just come, talk to us and leave, or come and just give audition and leave, or send someone else on your behalf, might have mail or whatsapp your profile. The more you think about it, more choices you will see and more outcome of that. I am not saying think of every scenario and become overwhelmed. My point that you have choices and each lead to different outcome, and that outcome is written by the your writer but decision that lead to that outcome if yours. if you had not come here and went home again, the outcome would be different. I hope you are understanding what I am saying."

**Me:** "Yeah, I understand now. I don't have control over other's decisions but I do have control on mine, that can influence other's decision.  I can't change your decision over not casting me, but next time when I will give audition, by my performance I can influence your thought over choosing me."

**Casting director:** "Exactly. Sorry that I can't cast with performance you gave next time do come prepared. and If you give great performance that, sure you will make seat for yourself in my upcoming projects."

**Me:** "Thank you so much for your guidance. I will practice and make sure to be prepare for my next audition, whether it be here or somewhere else." *Handshake with casting director*

**Casting director:** *With smile* "Best of luck for you practice and audition. Hope we meet again."

**Scene:** *Then left the office with desire to be better and with wisdom I was given*
